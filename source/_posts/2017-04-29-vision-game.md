This is a first attempt at designing a game to help a group find a common purpose. As a working title, it's called Vision Game.

{% newthought "To play" %}, you need some surface to draw on, easily visible by all of the players. This is the board.

{% marginfigure "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f2/Creation_of_Adam.jpg/640px-Creation_of_Adam.jpg" "If you attempt to name the unnameable goal of all life, you are no longer playing Vision Game. [(source)](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Creation_of_Adam.jpg)" %}
At the top-right corner of the board, draw a small circle. This circle must always remain empty. It represents the goal of all life, which everyone knows but no one can name.

Draw a larger circle at the bottom-left corner of the board, with enough space to put a few words or a drawing inside. This is the starting point.

{% newthought "The object" %} of Vision Game is to fill the starting point with a vision that all players expect to manifest in the next 3 months, at 2 to 1 odds or better. As soon as this happens, the players win.

To do this, the players must work backwards from the goal, adding visions that are successively smaller and nearer to the present. This means drawing additional circles, and filling them with names and pictures of ideas.

This process takes place in a series of rounds, with each round adding one new vision to the board.

{% newthought "At the start of a round," %} draw a new circle, and a line connecting it to a completed vision.

All players go into silence. The first to speak becomes the visionary, whose role is to present a vision to the other players.

{% marginfigure "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/52/Why_story-telling%3F.png/640px-Why_story-telling%3F.png" "It's a good idea to present your vision in the past tense, as though you were reporting what happened from the perspective of your future self. [(source)](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Why_story-telling%3F.png)" %}
A vision is a story of what might happen in the future. It must include a specific time, such as "next spring" or "seven generations hence". The more inspiring it is, the better.

{% newthought "The other players" %} must answer two questions:
- What are the odds that this vision will manifest?
- How much would the manifestation of this vision contribute to the odds that the next vision in line manifests?

To do this, the players break into groups of three to five participants. Each group selects one participant to be the facilitator of that group. The facilitator's role is to ask questions that reveal the group's beliefs, and prompt conversation that brings those beliefs closer together.

{% marginfigure "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3d/Casio_fx-991ES_Calculator.jpg/640px-Casio_fx-991ES_Calculator.jpg" "It's a good idea for facilitators to be equipped with calculators. [(source)](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Casio_fx-991ES_Calculator.jpg)" %}
{% newthought "After five minutes," %} the facilitator asks each participant to assign definite odds to the vision. The [geometric mean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_mean) of these numbers is the group's conclusion.

If there are three or more groups in total, each group then selects a representative. All players except the group representatives join the audience until the vision is complete. The representatives form new groups of three to five participants, and the process repeats until only one or two groups are left.

{% newthought "The conclusion" %} of the final group, or the geometric mean of the conclusions of the final two groups, is written{% sidenote "It's good to use a standard way of specifying odds, throughout the whole game. I would let one number, n, stand for \"odds of n to 500\", and I would put a plus before the increase in likelihood that a vision adds to the next step. So, if the previous step is \"500 +100\", and the next step is \"200 +0\", the chances that the next step manifests are 3 in 8 if the previous step manifests. Playtesting may reveal this to be excessively nerdy. We'll see." %} to one side of the circle drawn at the beginning of the round.

A name and/or picture of the vision itself is drawn inside the circle, indicating that the vision is complete. This happens at the end of the round, and not at the beginning, because the vision may have transformed during the process of assigning odds to it.

{% newthought "After winning the game," %} take a look at the board. On it, there should be a chain of visions, leading from the bottom left to the top right corner.

Each vision in the chain should be bigger and further in the future than the last. A logical progression should be visible; the visions themselves should form a continuous story, leading from the near future toward a distant paradise.

The measure of how well the game was played is very simple: it's the optimism of the players at the end, and their degree of engagement in making their common purpose come true.

If the game was a great success, the players will go forward with great enthusiasm and ease of cooperation. However, even in the best case, there will come a time where the visions that came out of the game are no longer relevant or no longer believable.

When that time comes, you can always play again.
