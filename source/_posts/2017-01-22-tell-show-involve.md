I'm not happy with [the first post]({{site.baseurl}}{% post_url 2016-12-24-hear-see-do %}) I wrote on education. I think it shows a habit I want to let go of: the "voice of God"{% marginfigure "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0b/10commandmentsCI.jpg" "I only wrote it down. If you have something to say about it, go to church. [(source)](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:10commandmentsCI.jpg)" %} writing style, where I state The Absolute Truth and give no space for response.

Why did I develop that habit? Because I didn't have [the will to receive]({{site.baseurl}}{% post_url 2017-01-08-will-to-receive %}) responses, and I needed a way to protect myself from them. It's an old habit, and I wasn't aware that I was still doing it, even now that I'm secure enough in myself to invite being called out{% sidenote "Incidentally, this is my first post on ultroneous.org after installing a comment system. I'm *totally comfortable* with the idea of you using it. Church is pretty great, too, though. Think about it." %} as the fool/liar I sometimes am. This morning someone pointed it out to me -- in a really sweet, unpretentious, no-blame way -- for which I am tremendously grateful.

{% newthought "On another note," %} I still didn't have that [aforementioned]({{site.basurl}}{% post_url 2017-01-03-anima-strategy %}) conversation with the wise woman, but yesterday I had a conversation with *another* wise woman. She helped me move a couple of my most urgent questions: the question about love, which I still want to talk with that first wise woman about, and the question about "education".{% marginfigure "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/66/Classroom_010.jpg/320px-Classroom_010.jpg" "\"Education\". [(source)](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Classroom_010.jpg)" %}

She had a position as an educator, in Tamera in 2016. I almost always wince around "education", but, listening to her story of the experience, I believe what she did in that time really *was* education,{% marginfigure "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cc/Maker_Faire_2007_-_Pedal_Powered_Ride_%28508212328%29.jpg/320px-Maker_Faire_2007_-_Pedal_Powered_Ride_%28508212328%29.jpg" "Education. [(source)](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Maker_Faire_2007_-_Pedal_Powered_Ride_(508212328).jpg)" %} without quote marks.

She knows how to learn. She's one of the very few people I've met that I can say that about.

{% newthought "In the first post" %} I shared this excerpt from the [Xunzi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xunzi_(book)):

| 不闻不若闻之， | Not to hear is not as good as to hear it, |
| 闻之不若见之， | to hear it is not as good as to see it, |
| 见之不若知之， | to see it is not as good as to know it, |
| 知之不若行之。 | to know it is not as good as to work it. |

Over generations and across cultures, it seems to have mutated into this:{% sidenote "Plug it into some search engines. They love it! So many results! So many opinions! So many well-intentioned teachers, wishing to involve their students more, and so few who take the next step of realizing *the concept of school itself* is what stands in the way." %}

> Tell me, and I forget.
> 
> Show me, and I remember.
> 
> Involve me, and I understand.

This formulation is a bit more useful, if your aim is to educate *other* people, and not only yourself.

{% newthought "I'm deeply bothered" %} by the \"education\" I see in Tamera,{% sidenote "An incomplete list of important institutions in Tamera: Love School. School Mirja. Akron School. Thinking School. I sense a common enthusiasm that I do not share." %} and I'm far from the only one; in the last few months there's been a great deal of collective thought put into how to change it.

That hasn't comforted me, though. As far as I can tell the general movement is toward a system that more closely reproduces what you find in every school and every university -- an intensification of the same patterns I already see here, every day:

{% marginfigure "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/20/Alma_Mater_Europaea_university_graduation_ceremony._Maribor%2C_Slovenia%2C_12_March_2013.png" "Finally done learning to be a revolutionary model for a future without war. Let's go get drunk! [(source)](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Alma_Mater_Europaea_university_graduation_ceremony._Maribor,_Slovenia,_12_March_2013.png)" %}
* Achievement is measured by endurance.
* The population is segregated by seniority.
* Time is fragmented by the clock.
* Almost no time is given to practice.

In such systems, no one really learns anything except how to play the roles of student and teacher.

{% newthought "I was struggling" %} to see how I could continue in Tamera, with so many people who have an idea of education so radically different{% sidenote "I will write \"different\" here, to disguise the fact that I really mean \"stupid\" and \"wrong\"." %} from mine, until that conversation yesterday, where I realized: next year there will be someone *leading* one of these crazy pseudo-classrooms who actually knows how to learn. Which means she knows what helps others learn, too.

I would like to be in the same group as her. I can easily imagine she'll find ways to subvert the system she's in, especially with savvy "students" around her.{% sidenote "I try to be savvy. I'll let you call me a student, but I'm certainly not going to *act* like one, if that gets in the way of learning." %} I don't know if I actually *will* be in her group; the people around me expect I'll be in another group entirely, where my vision isn't quite so optimistic, but that doesn't matter to me nearly as much to me now.

I can see that *somewhere*, someone will be doing it the right way. I don't mind if I don't happen to be in that place. It only means I have different work to do.{% sidenote "I can try to improve things wherever I am, and it's much easier if I have healthy examples nearby. If I would complain about working in a toxic waste dump beside an ecotopian palace, you'd be right to call my commitment to healing into question." %}

I still hope to be somewhere I enjoy being, though.

{% newthought "As a young person," %} who can, I think, speak for many others, I want to send a general wish out into the universe:

I don't want to be taught. I want to be involved.
