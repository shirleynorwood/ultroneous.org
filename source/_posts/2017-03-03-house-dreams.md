It is a tricky thing to form a [household]({% post_url 2017-02-14-new-kind-household %}) in a world where no such thing previously existed. It requires, first of all, imagination.

Tom is an imaginative boy. He imagines a household. He calls it the House of Dreams.

The House of Dreams is a household that doesn't exist. To exist, it needs a purpose.

The purpose of the House of Dreams is simple. It is *to make dreams come true*. Now, it should be noted, the House of Dreams itself is a dream.

Tom sleeps. He dreams of a hat. The hat has the characteristic that the wearer belongs to the House of Dreams.

He puts the hat on his head, and a question arises in his mind: what does it mean to make the dream of making dreams come true come true?

Tom wakes up. He follows his dream. He approaches Cheryl.

"Excuse me", he says. "Do you dream?"

"Yes", she says. "I dream of origami."

"That's perfect", he says, because every dream is perfect for the House of Dreams. "I invite you to join me in the House of Dreams."

"What does that mean?"

"It means: we work together to make dreams come true."

"Now I'm suspicious that your dream is to sleep with me."

"No", he says, defensively. "My dream is the House of Dreams."

"But what is the House of Dreams?"

"It's-- er-- you see-- it makes dreams come true?"

It is a tricky thing to form a household in a world where no such thing previously existed.
